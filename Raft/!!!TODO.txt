- Leader stores separately log entry request and doesn't apply them until receives prior COMMIT
- Commit initiates new entry appliance and generates committed entry event
- Only current term log entries can be applied by leader
- timeout on log entry apply as separately supplied value
- leader auto resend of requests unless not-committed within timeout

- Redirect addLogs to leader with returning requestID and later redirect of COMMIT-OK back

- cleanup of temp tables ?
- config change?
