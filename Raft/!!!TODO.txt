- Leader stores separately log entry requests and doesn't apply them until receives prior COMMIT
- Commit initiates new entry appliance and generates committed entry event
- Only current term log entries can be applied by leader
- timeout on log entry apply as separately supplied parameter
- leader auto resend of request, unless it's not committed within timeout

- Redirect addLogs to leader with returning requestID and later redirect of COMMIT-OK back

- Saving also latest commit date together with index and term

- cleanup of temp tables ?
- config change?
